  - "This month I tried thinking of different ways to make life easier around the
    farm. Maybe I can find a way to make watering easier or pulling weeds! Unfortunately
    I have no idea how to do any of this\u2026 I\u2019ll leave that to future me."

  - "I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on the bushes around the farm during this month
    since I\u2019ve been finding animal bones scattered around them. Originally I
    thought something dangerous made its home in them but I haven\u2019t seen anything\u2026
    I\u2019m not sure what else could be killing those critters."

    well and greet the creature that now dwells within. In exchange for a bit of
    my crops it brings up some water from its home so that I may water the fields.
    A wonderful exchange I\u2019d say."
