  - "It was so nice to eat Clove\u2019s cooking again, she\u2019s a genius in the
    kitchen! She\u2019s been showing me a few things lately and now I can confidently
    help her out. Food has never tasted better!"
  - "I\u2019ve burned yet another dish in our cookbook, I don\u2019t know how Clove
    did it. I miss her cooking a lot\u2026 maybe I can get Pandora to give me a few
    pointers."
  - "Clove took some of the crops to try and make something out of them for dinner
    a few days ago but shortly after she tossed it out and pushed me out the door
    to buy some groceries instead. I wonder what spooked her? Hope a worm hadn\u2019t
    made a home in my produce, that would be bad for business!"
  - "I tried to make dinner out of some of my new crops but something tasted\u2026
    off about it. Now I know that my cooking usually tastes a little odd, but this
    was on a different level. All I can hope is that it wasn\u2019t my crops and
    instead my cooking has simply gotten worse."
  - "I\u2019ve gotten Clove to take walks with me again this month but I\u2019m not
    sure I can convince her to come again after the last one. We came across some
    kind of abomination that she claims looks like the doctor\u2019s son, but it
    looks more like a beast to me. A shame, I know those two got along quite well."
  - "During my last walk I came across quite a strange creature hanging around the
    doctor\u2019s house. When I asked about it, she claimed to not know what happened
    past eating some of my crops last month then asked if I had some more. At least
    they\u2019re enjoying the produce."
