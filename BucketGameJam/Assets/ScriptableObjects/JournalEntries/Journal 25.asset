  - "Clove and I visited the rancher a few times this month to help out with his
    animals. She absolutely loved it! I really should think about expanding the farm\u2026
    the cows would definitely bring in some extra income and sis has already promised
    to take care of them if we do!"
  - "I found myself helping out the rancher a few times this month. Doing all that
    hard work made me realize I should probably stick with what I have unless I manage
    to hire some help. There isn\u2019t really a point in keeping cows anyway\u2026
    not anymore."
  - "Clove came running back to the house with tears in her eyes last week and some
    nasty cuts on her arm, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me where they came from. If
    I remember correctly she wanted to explore her favorite flower field\u2026 it\u2019s
    probably best that she doesn\u2019t head over there for a while."
  - I tried to visit Clove last week but the flowers near her grave gave me quite
    the fight to reach her. I walked away with more than my fair share of injury
    but I refuse to be kept from seeing her.
  - "Last month, Clove went scrounging around in our storage saying she wanted to
    clean up the place but it wasn\u2019t long before she claimed she was done. I
    asked her why and she just shook her head and pointed at the photo album with
    tears in her eyes. I\u2019d throw it out, but she just seemed even more upset
    when I suggested it. The book is now buried in our storage as a compromise."
  - "I was purging the storage last month of any\u2026 unfortunate reminders when
    I stumbled across the photo album. I grew weak and opened it but was surprised
    to find the images inside distorted past recognition, some even having figures
    that weren\u2019t there before. I decided to toss it out, but I kept one picture.
    I can\u2019t even recognize it\u2019s my sister anyway."
