  entryTexts:
  - "Clove and Oliver have been going on a few more adventures together into town
    during the past couple of weeks. I think Oliver wanted to say hi to a few of
    the townsfolk and tagged along with my sister. I don\u2019t blame her for wanting
    to take a walk, she\u2019s been in bed for so long after all!"
  - "Oliver has been following me into town lately, wanders off for a few minutes,
    then comes right back. I think he\u2019s been visiting a few of his old friends
    in town\u2026 can\u2019t complain, the company is a lot nicer than walking alone."
  - "It\u2019s been getting harder and harder to find things for Clove to do outside
    anymore with everything that\u2019s been happening lately. I hate telling her
    to stay inside again but the rumors worry me\u2026 maybe we could take a walk
    together through town. I\u2019d feel a lot better if I was with her."
  - "It\u2019s getting more difficult to head outside and simply explore for the
    sake of it anymore and even harder to ignore what\u2019s been going on around
    town. I wish I knew what was causing all of this\u2026 but maybe some things
    are better left unknown."
  - "Clove has been giving me odd looks lately and I\u2019m not sure why. I feel
    perfectly fine. Terrific even! And yet she looks at me as if I\u2019m a monster.
    Well she may give all the looks she pleases but that doesn't change that I\u2019m
    her brother\u2026 and there\u2019s nothing she can do about that."
  - "My body has felt\u2026 strange lately. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening
    but\u2026 I feel stronger. Better than I ever have before. Perhaps this is a
    gift for all that I have accomplished\u2026 and all the loss that I\u2019ve endured."
