  - "I decided to do a little fishing this month during my free time to try and bring
    in a little something different to eat. The fishermen make this look so easy!
    It took a while and when I managed to catch a fish it wasn\u2019t really big
    enough to eat. Maybe Oliver will like a little treat."

  - "During the past month I tried to visit the pond for a little fishing but found
    that the waters have turned black. It seems the plants haven\u2019t been poisoned
    and I heard a few frogs when I got closer, but the screeching of birds made me
    turn back. I\u2019m not sure what happened but it\u2019s probably best to steer
    clear for now."

  - "I took a walk near the pond in order to try and find some frogs to go with dinner
    a few weeks ago and found quite a large shadow swimming under the surface. I\u2019m
    not sure how comfortable it is in such a small area\u2026 perhaps the pond is
    deeper than I thought. Maybe I should leave some crops as an offering?"
