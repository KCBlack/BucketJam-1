    been hit in the face with quite a few leaves! Luckily I haven\u2019t been hit
    with something bigger but I should still try to be careful if this weather keeps
    up."

    the statue in front had disappeared. I thought that maybe something had happened
    to it but\u2026 later that day I saw it standing in an alley covering its face
    with its hands. I wonder how it got there?"

  - "For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been feeling rumbling on the farm like an earthquake
    is passing through. Curious, I followed them to the source one day and found
    quite a deep hole in the ground near the forests that looked suspiciously\u2026
    fleshy. Perhaps it is hungry and that\u2019s what the tremors are for? I should
    try tossing some crops in and see if that solves anything."
