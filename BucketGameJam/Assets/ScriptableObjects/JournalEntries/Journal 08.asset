  - A traveling merchant came around town today and had a lot of cute toys for sale!
    I bought a teddy bear for Clove in order to cheer her up so I hope she likes
    it!

  - "A few days ago I decided to take a longer route to the shop than usual which
    led me to the town square. Normally it\u2019s pretty busy, always has been for
    as long as I can remember, but it was eerily quiet today. I wonder where everyone
    is? Maybe the mists this last month drove them inside."
