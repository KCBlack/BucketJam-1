  - We visited the well again to play with the other kids this month after the doc
    gave Clove the all-clear. It was amazing to see her smile like that again, not
    to mention all the fun we had together!
  - "Lately I\u2019ve been trying to avoid the well during my walks in town. I\u2019ll
    stop by and say hi to the other kids soon but\u2026 it\u2019s a bit too painful
    right now"
  - "Clove swears the scarecrow has been staring at her the past couple weeks. I\u2019m
    not sure how it could with buttons for eyes, but I\u2019ve put it in the shed
    for now. I\u2019ll just figure out a different way to keep the birds away."
  - "I\u2019m not sure why but it feels like someone has been watching me the past
    few weeks. Whenever I look around there isn\u2019t anyone aside from myself and
    the scarecrow but\u2026 it can\u2019t be that right?"
  - "According to Clove, some of the toys that I bought for her have been moving
    during the night. Interesting. It would be nice if they\u2019d help around the
    farm but perhaps I will settle for them entertaining my sister. And if they ever
    hurt her\u2026 well they\u2019ll just wish they hadn\u2019t."
  - "A few of Clove\u2019s old things seem to be walking around in the night as if
    looking for something. I\u2019ve warned them to stay out of my sight if they
    wish to keep their lives and for now they\u2019ve listened. I don\u2019t wish
    to see any reminders of her."
