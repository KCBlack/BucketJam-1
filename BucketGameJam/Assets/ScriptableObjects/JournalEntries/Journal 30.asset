    star gazing so much. As much of a morning person as I am, I do really like the
    quiet during nighttime. I\u2019ll just have to catch up on some sleep during
    the next few days."

  - "Last month I tried to do some stargazing since the mist had been pretty clear
    during the night, but I was usually forced to head inside early. I\u2019m not
    sure why, but there were times where the stars would blink away for several minutes
    before coming back. Almost as if something was covering the sky\u2026 but that
    isn\u2019t possible right?"

  - "Another traveler has chosen to visit our town but I can\u2019t say I recognize
    them. When I spoke to them they said the previous merchant had lost his way.
    It doesn\u2019t matter to me, this new traveler had much more interesting wares
    to sell anyway."
