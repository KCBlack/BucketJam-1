  - I manage to make a huge tear in my overalls this month. Thankfully Clove is better
    at sewing than I am and the patch we chose looks great! Hopefully, it will last
    for a long time.
  - "I tore a hole in my overalls today. Unfortunately, I had to throw them out since
    the damage is a bit too much for my skill level\u2026 Clove might have been able
    to fix it\u2026"
  - "While Clove and I were out on a walk we happened to cross the town graveyard.
    It\u2019s strange but it almost looks as though some of the graves have been
    freshly dug? There aren\u2019t any new headstones from what I can tell though\u2026"
  - "I accidentally wandered too close to the graveyard a few weeks ago. I\u2019ve
    been trying to avoid it for\u2026 obvious reasons. The graves looked pretty strange
    but I didn\u2019t stick around too long to investigate. A few rumors have been
    floating around town about graves being freshly dug and concerns about grave
    robbing. I should keep an eye on Clove\u2019s just in case."
  - "Clove ran in screaming a couple weeks ago, pointing to the shed. I investigated
    for her sake knowing I\u2019d find the growing spider population where she directed
    me. If they\u2019re bothering her I\u2019ll find a way to dispose of them this
    month. It\u2019s a shame though, they\u2019ve been helpful in accumulating some
    birds for my crops."
  - "The spiders behind the shed are starting to grow past their allowed area and
    it\u2019s time to correct their behavior. I\u2019ve found them helpful with finding
    \u2018fertilizer\u2019 but they need to remember who the owner of this land is."
