  - "My sister took a liking to the cat (as I predicted) and has named him Oliver.
    The little guy is now officially part of the family! He\u2019s been a great help
    in keeping the mice at bay so it\u2019s the least I can do!"
  - "I decided to adopt the stray cat for a little more company after my sister\u2019s
    passing and named him Oliver. He\u2019s been a great help with pest control and
    cheering me up lately, so I wanted to make it official."
  - "Clove has decided to name the cat Oliver but she\u2019s been a bit hesitant
    to approach my little helper. I couldn\u2019t say why, he\u2019s been perfectly
    nice to me. Maybe Oliver is just shy?"
  - "I\u2019m a little worried for the cat that\u2019s been helping me with the mice
    problem. He\u2019s as nice as always but I think something\u2019s been bothering
    him lately and I can\u2019t tell what. I hope he hasn\u2019t been injured by
    anything, I don\u2019t think I could bear losing him too."
  - "Clove\u2019s telling me that she's been seeing a small cat hanging around the
    house. I told her that it was impossible but I\u2019ve been keeping an eye out
    for it again. I\u2019d rather not have any other nuisances around, the crops
    like the mice too much for any kind of competition. "
  - "While tending to my crops I could\u2019ve sworn I saw that cat hanging around
    again but that\u2019s impossible. I got rid of that thing months ago. Must\u2019ve
    been a trick of the light"
