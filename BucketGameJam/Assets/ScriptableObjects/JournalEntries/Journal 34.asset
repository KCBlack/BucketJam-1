  - "There was a HUGE storm that lasted for a couple days during this month. I was
    worried my crops wouldn\u2019t make it! Luckily they all pulled through and I
    didn\u2019t have to water for a few days, a win-win if you ask me."

  - "There were quite a few storms this month but\u2026 there was something weird
    about them. After the rain passed there was such a dark sheen to the water rather
    than the clear drops that I\u2019m used to. It\u2019s hard to place the color
    but my best guess would be a dark purple? It almost reminds me of the mist that\u2019s
    been around town lately."

  - "Some of the townspeople came to my house this month asking if they might have
    some of my crop to offer to the Great Ones. Their cloaks suggested they live
    under the jurisdiction of the Eye. I turned them towards Pandora as I have for
    all the others, I don\u2019t play favorites as they do."
