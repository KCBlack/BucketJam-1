  - "This past month I\u2019ve been trying to keep up with the flower beds near the
    house but ironically enough my growing skills don\u2019t extend to flowers. Clove
    laughed, rolled up her sleeves, and took over the beds herself and they\u2019re
    looking a lot better than what I was trying to do! The house looks great with
    all the flowers blooming and Clove is saying she wants to help me with the farm!
    Two pairs of hands are better than one I always say!"
  - "During the past month I noticed that the flowers growing around the house haven\u2019t
    been doing so well so I tried to revive them. Nothing I did was working so I
    unfortunately had to pull up the plants. The house looks more depressing but
    the wilting flowers weren\u2019t helping with that either. There isn\u2019t really
    any reason to keep them anyway, Clove was the one to suggest them\u2026 maybe
    I\u2019ll try again next month."
  - "Clove mentioned the other day while tending to the flowers around the house
    that she could\u2019ve sworn one of the flowers reached out for her. I headed
    out myself but didn\u2019t see the plants move, maybe it was a trick of the light?
    In either case Clove refuses to touch the beds again. It\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll
    see what I can do with them."
  - "The flower beds are starting to get quite overgrown but I can\u2019t bring myself
    to do something about them. Clove loved the flowers and I don\u2019t want to
    see them go. However, whenever I\u2019m passing them I could swear I see something
    twitching out of the corner of my eye. Probably just a small critter making a
    home."
  - "I\u2019ve had to practically quarantine Clove inside starting this month, regardless
    of her personal feelings. I have valid reasoning, during the past few weeks she
    was unresponsive to all attempts to get her attention. Fearing she was sick again
    I prodded around and found a small creature attached to the base of her neck
    and disposed of it promptly. She\u2019s fine now thankfully but seemed a bit\u2026
    disappointed after waking up. I refuse for something like that to happen again."
  - "When I last dropped off my crops to Pandora she warned me to stay inside for
    a few weeks. I asked why but all she said was that she \u201Cdidn\u2019t want
    to lose her best supplier to any stupid dreams\u201D. Whatever that means. Regardless,
    it's probably best to heed her advice."
