I tried planting carrots this last month but they all ended up ruined… guess I’ll just stick to turnips for now.,A few days ago I decided to take a longer route to the shop than usual which took me by the town square. Normally it’s pretty busy` always has been for as long as I can remember` but it was eerily quiet today. I wonder where everyone is? Maybe the fogs this last month drove them inside. {first entry for sure},I’ve had to chase off that wretched cat one too many times this month… the infernal thing has been stalking my crops for the last time. Meat has been scarce ever since the rancher “disappeared”. Perhaps it’s time to set out some traps…,I… I didn’t make it. My sister she’s… gone. The illness took her during the night. She seemed fine during the day I never thought that she’d… I thought I had more time! It’s all my fault… {next line} The doc helped me with burial preparations. She’s resting out on the flower field on the farm that she loved so much… I hope she likes it…,(Supernatural Ref) Three strange men appeared in town at the start of last month. Two claimed to be monster hunters` and the 3rd claimed to be an angel. I don’t believe in angels due to what’s been happening around here` but we sure could use some monster hunters. The trio went around asking questions in town` but when they got to me they seemed.. Suspicious of me? I’m not sure why` I'm completely normal. They spent the whole month searching around town` and I found them snooping around my house the other day. Yesterday I woke up and found every eldritch fruit I'd planted had been dug up and stolen` and the trio had bounced from town. Why would they steal my crops?
Almost had a heart attack when my hoe broke earlier this month! Luckily I found some wood glue buried in the shed and it looks good as new!,I swung by the well towards the beginning of the month but… I can’t say I’ve been back. When I approached there seemed to be a strange mist flowing from the top and I could swear I saw a tentacle creeping around the rim.,I can hear the crows squawking outside. Mocking me. Those blasted birds won’t be laughing for long… I hope they like my little treat I’ve left for them in the crops. We’ll see who's laughing then.,I finally got the medicine this month! The doc and I have been hovering admittedly but she’s doing a lot better than before. Doc even said she’ll be able to go outside next month! I’m relieved I was able to make it in time… I don’t even want to think about what might have happened if I didn’t.,(Doctor Who Ref) A few weeks ago a blue box appeared in the town square by the well. A strange man walked out of it` I wonder why he was hiding in such a small box and why he dragged it here in the first place. He came to my farm and told me he was from the future` and that I should stop messing with things I don’t understand. He said I was messing with the wibbly wobbly timey wimey flow of the universe. I don’t understand what he means` i’m only planting crops and selling them to save my sister. Yesterday he was racing towards my house` followed by a strange purple mist` and shouting for me to open my door. I didn’t` I feel as though this was another trick being played on me. The mist overtook him and he disappeared. Perhaps he was another hallucination. 
There was a HUGE storm that lasted for a couple days during this month. I was worried my crops wouldn’t make it! Luckily they all pulled through and I didn’t have to water for a few days` a win-win if you ask me.,The shopkeeper has been acting a little… off lately. I’m not sure what’s been going on with her but she’s been a lot more distant and pushy about when I complete my crops. I hope she isn’t in any trouble…,During the past month the mist has managed to completely block the sun. Good. My crops prefer the dark anyway. {probably the first in the low sanity route},I got more than enough money to save my sister! I got her the medicine she needed at the beginning of the month` and she’s been doing much better! She seems a bit scared of me though` I'm not sure why. She spends most of her time away from home and avoiding me` but comes running back home every once in a while` looking as if she’d seen something terrible. She never tells me what she was scared of though` she just runs to her room and ignores me. Perhaps i’ll buy her a new toy so she calms down a bit.,(Full-Metal Alchemist Ref) This month has been strange… I noticed the daughter of the town’s doctor playing with her orange cat in town a few times.. But she’s not been in town lately` I wonder where she went… However` one day when I was walking back to my farm from the shop` I noticed a strange creature hiding in one of the alleyways. It was about the size of the girl I'd seen in town` but was misshapen and covered in orange fur. It had large whiskers and sharp claws… However` I was not frightened… for some reason` I felt saddened… the creature looked helpless and scared… It even tried calling out to me` presumably for help` but I have learned to ignore the whispers of strange creatures and disembodied voices over these past few months. I will not fall for it’s tricks. Perhaps i’ll inform the town's animal control.
I was talking to the rancher a lot this month about maybe adding some animals to my farm (especially since my sister loves his cows). He told me it would probably be really hard to care for them in such a small space. Guess my surprise will have to wait until I expand…,During the past month I tried to visit the pond for a little fishing but found that the waters have turned black. It seems the plants haven’t been poisoned and I heard a few frogs when I got closer` but the screeching of birds made me turn back. I’m not sure what happened but it’s probably best to steer clear for now. {implication is that a bird was being eaten by a frog},The shopkeeper tells me that my crops have been of excellent quality for her clients lately. Maybe that’s where she vanishes after I leave` she hasn’t even been trying to hide her disappearing act anymore. I don’t really care anyway` as long as I get my money she can do whatever she wants.,,
I’ve been walking around town a lot and it’s been great to see the kids playing in the square. I remember playing with my sister and the other children before she fell ill. I hope we can all play together again soon.,I’m not sure what’s been going on but the houses nearest the well look like they’re… melting? It’s difficult to describe but I doubt they’re safe to live in anymore. I’ve asked a few of the residents if they need help with repairs but they seem to think it’s perfectly normal. Maybe it’s best to steer clear just in case they collapse.,Our ever-seeing-eye has graced my farm with its presence this month. It surveyed the crops and I believe it was happy with what it saw. Perhaps that means my crops will be of extra quality.,,
I saw a small cat creeping around the alleys this month. Looked like it didn’t have an owner so I’ve been making small offerings and slowly leading it towards the house. Hopefully it’ll come around the farm and keep the mice away.,It feels like the birds have been acting strange since last month. Their cries have become a lot more… unnerving. And that isn’t even mentioning what I think are more eyes along their neck? I haven’t been able to get close enough to really tell…,I paid a visit to the ranch this month in order to purchase some meat but couldn’t find the rancher. The cows seem to have grown quite the appetite though and the air stunk of copper. Perhaps that would explain where he’s disappeared.,,
The doctor visited us again today for the monthly check-up… she told me my sister won’t have much time left unless I can buy the medicine she needs next month. I hope I can make it in time… {this will probably be the entry right before the 20 day time limit},The merchant came into town this month and he seemed… afraid to say the least. Normally he stays for around a week before leaving but this time he left after a couple days. I wonder what it was that spooked him?,I’ve tried cooking meals out of my crops for my sister this month. Perhaps they will help her in ways that medicine never could. Unfortunately she refused my cooking again and again` I even tasted it myself and everything. Can’t she see I’m just trying to help?,,
I couldn’t resist keeping a few of my crops this month to try out cooking again. My sister was always the one making our meals before falling ill. It was a complete disaster… guess I should leave the complicated stuff to her!,The mice have become more relentless and it’s becoming quite a problem. I’ve seen the cat manage to hunt a few of them but he’s been avoiding them recently. After taking a look at them myself I can’t really blame the poor thing` their teeth seemed to have sharpened somehow. Maybe I’ll give the cat some food as a thanks for his efforts.,Another traveler has chosen to visit our town but I can’t say I recognize them. When I spoke to them they said the previous merchant had lost his way. It doesn’t matter to me` this new traveler had much more interesting wares to sell anyway. ,,
This month I tried thinking of different ways to make life easier around the farm. Maybe I can find a way to make watering easier or pulling weeds! Unfortunately I have no idea how to do any of this… I’ll leave that to future me.,During one of my walks last month I came across one of the women I helped with getting water from the well and she looked a bit sickly. I referred her to the doctor but she insisted she was fine. I hope she really is` those sores looked pretty serious.,At the beginning of this past month I’ve made it a habit to walk near the well and greet the creature that now dwells within. In exchange for a bit of my crops it brings up some water from its home so that I may water the fields. A wonderful exchange I’d say.,,
Browsing around some tools in the shop made me realize how old a few of mine are and I was tempted to buy some new ones. But I resisted! If it isn’t broken or I can’t fix it then I’ll think about it again but right now every penny needs to go towards that medicine!,I went out near the flower fields to try and bring some back for my sister` but they all looked pretty sickly. It was pretty sad to see them in that state` but I did find a few that were still in full bloom! I had to be pretty careful when picking them though` I could’ve sworn they tried to bite me.,I’ve found that leaving the weeds in the ground provide food for my crops. Well I won’t complain about one last task to complete` plus it’s entertaining to watch the weeds disappear from the crops’ attacks.,,
I helped out a few of the older ladies with drawing up water from the well and they gave me a meal as thanks! It was sooo tasty… hopefully I can share a meal like this with my sister soon out in town!,I’ve passed by the ranch quite a few times this month to chat with the rancher. He seems nervous about something but I’m not really sure what. Though looking at the cows I might have a few ideas…, ,,
Lately I’ve been finding quite a few small furry visitors around the farm in the form of mice. While I am all for making new friends these are the kind that are interested in my crops which I’d like to avoid. I’ve managed to keep them safe for now but I need to find a solution… {should probably be before the first appearance of the cat},The weeds have gotten more difficult to pull up lately. Their root systems have gotten tougher and I think they are starting to… squirm? It feels like they are gripping onto the dirt. Maybe I should think about looking for weed killers.,,,
A traveling merchant came around town today and had a lot of cute toys for sale! I bought a teddy bear for my sister in order to cheer her up so I hope she likes it!,,,,
During the last month I tried out a few different creative hobbies to keep myself busy like basket weaving and crochet. All of my attempts didn’t turn out too well…maybe I’ll just stick to doodling and farming.,,,,
I found a small family of spiders making their home near the shed this past month. As long as they don’t go after my crops and only eat the other bugs around then they can stay (even if I’m not their biggest fan but they’re outside so I shouldn’t complain), ,,,
I’ve been trying out a new type of fertilizer this month and I think I saw some improvement in my crops? It’s a little hard to tell if there’s a difference honestly but at least I can always tell when something is wrong!,,,,
One of my least favorite things about farming has to be weed management. It can be so difficult to keep them out of my crops and this month it seemed like they had it out for me! It doesn’t matter though` I refuse to let them win this battle!,,,,
This month I set a goal for myself to clean up our house storage a little and found some old pictures! My sister looks so cute as a baby!,,,,
It’s a nice sunny day outside which means today is a perfect day to plant! My sister suggested writing in a journal to keep memories and talk about farming` but I can’t promise that I’ll remember to write everyday. Maybe I’ll start out with at least one entry a month. {first entry I’d say},,According to my sister` some of the toys that I bought for her this past month have been moving during the night. Interesting. It would be helpful if they’d help around the farm but perhaps I will settle for them entertaining my sister. And if they ever hurt her… well they’ll just wish they hadn’t. [if not cured] A few of my sister’s old things seem to be walking around in the night as if looking for something. I’ve warned them to stay out of my sight if they wish to keep their lives and for now they’ve listened. I don’t wish to see any reminders of her.,,
Looking around the shop I noticed a few saplings for sale this month and was reminded about how my sister and I would climb whatever tree we could get our hands on. Maybe I should think about growing a few fruit trees on the farm` it might be fun to have some trees close to home!,,My sister has been giving me odd looks lately and I’m not sure why. I feel perfectly fine. Terrific even! And yet she looks at me as if I’m a monster. Well she may give all the looks she pleases but that doesn't change that I’m her brother… and there’s nothing she can do about that. [if not cured] My body has felt… strange lately. I don’t know what’s happening but… I feel stronger. Better than I ever have before. Perhaps this is a gift for all that I have accomplished… and all the loss that I’ve endured. {maybe the last entry?},,
Tis’ the season for bird migrations` which also means I need to be on guard! I’ve made some repairs to my trusty partner` the scarecrow. I’m again reminded that my sewing skills need some help` but maybe my scary stitching will help keep some of the birds away.,My sister swears the scarecrow has been staring at her during the last couple of weeks. I’m not sure how it could with buttons for eyes` but I’ve put it in the shed for now. I’ll just figure out a different way to keep the birds away. [if not cured] I’m not sure why but it feels like someone has been watching me the past few weeks. Whenever I look around there isn’t anyone aside from myself and the scarecrow but… it can’t be that right? Maybe I should keep an eye on it just in case.,I’ve gotten my sister to take walks with me again this month but I’m not sure I can convince her to come again after the last one. We came across some kind of abomination that she claims looks like Doc’s son` but it looks more like a beast to me. A shame` I know those two got along quite well. [if not cured] During my last walk I came across quite a strange creature hanging around the doctor’s house. When I asked she claimed to not know what happened past eating some of my crops last month then asked when I’ll have some more. At least they’re enjoying the produce.,,
I set out to fix some of the various repairs that need to be done around the house this month. It’s hard work` especially the roof repairs` but anything I can do to make my sister more comfortable is worth it.,,,,
It’s been really windy around town this month` so windy in fact that I’ve been hit in the face with quite a few leaves! Luckily I haven’t been hit with something bigger but I should still try to be careful if this weather keeps up.,,,,
From what I can tell my plan to combat the mice has been working with the help of my new feline friend! I’ve noticed a big decrease in the rodents lately and have seen the stray hanging around the fields. I should start leaving out some water for him so he won’t go thirsty. Thanks for the help little guy!,,,,
I decided to do a little fishing this month during my free time to try and bring in a little something different to eat. The fishermen make this look so easy! It took a while and when I managed to catch a fish it wasn’t really big enough to eat. Maybe Oliver will like a little treat. {after day 20},,,,
The shopkeeper asked for my help with restocking her shelves. Apparently her usual helpers needed to travel this month and she wasn’t able to find temporary replacements. It’s nice to think she trusts me enough to ask for help` and she even promised me a meal in exchange! ,,,,
The sky was really clear this month so my sleep schedule is a little off from star gazing so much. As much of a morning person as I am` I do really like the quiet during nighttime. I’ll just have to catch up on some sleep during the next few days.,,,,
I decided to adopt the stray cat for a little more company after my sister’s passing and named him Oliver. He’s been a great help with pest control and cheering me up lately` so I wanted to make it official.,,,,
I’ve burned yet another dish in our cookbook` I don’t know how my sister did it. I miss her cooking a lot… maybe I can get the shopkeeper to give me a few pointers.,,,,
I tore a hole in my overalls today. Unfortunately I had to throw them out since the damage is a bit too much for my skill level… my sister might have been able to fix it…,,,,
I found myself helping out the racher a few times this month. Doing all that hard work made me realize I should probably stick with what I have unless I manage to hire some help. There isn’t really a point in keeping cows anyway… not anymore.,,,,
Lately I’ve been trying to avoid the well during my walks in town. I’ll stop by and say hi to the other kids soon but… it’s a bit too painful right now {I’d say this would probably happen right after the 20 day entry},,,,
Stumbled across my failed art projects in the shed a few weeks ago and had to throw them out. It makes me sad to see my effort in the trash but I need room for my new tools… no reason not to buy a basket anyway.,,,,
Oliver has been following me into town lately` wanders off for a few minutes` then comes right back. I think he’s been visiting a few of his old friends in town… can’t complain` the company is a lot nicer than walking alone.,,,,
During the past month I noticed that the flowers growing around the house haven’t been doing so well so I tried to revive them. Nothing I did was working so I unfortunately had to pull up the plants. The house looks more depressing but the wilting flowers weren’t helping with that either. There isn’t really any reason to keep them anyway` my sister was the one to suggest them… maybe I’ll try again next month.,,,,
I’ve been practicing my drawing this month since I’ve had so much fun with doodling lately! I tried out sketching some of my crops and I think it turned out pretty well!,,,,
